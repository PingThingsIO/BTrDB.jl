E.g 30 would make the window duration accurate to roughly 1 second\n\nNotes\n\nWindows returns arbitrary precision windows from BTrDB. It is slower than AlignedWindows, but still significantly faster than RawValues. Each returned window will be width nanoseconds long. start is inclusive, but end is exclusive (e.g if end < start+width you will get no results). That is, results will be returned for all windows that start at a time less than the end timestamp. If (end - start) is not a multiple of width, then end will be decreased to the greatest value less than end such that (end - start) is a multiple of width (i.e., we set end = start + width * floordiv(end - start, width). The depth parameter is an optimization that can be used to speed up queries on fast queries. Each window will be accurate to 2^depth nanoseconds. If depth is zero, the results are accurate to the nanosecond. On a dense stream for large windows, this accuracy may not be required. For example for a window of a day, +- one second may be appropriate, so a depth of 30 can be specified. This is much faster to execute on the database side.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/functions/#BTrDB.aligned_windows","page":"Functions","title":"BTrDB.aligned_windows","text":"aligned_windows(stream::Stream, start::Int64, stop::Int64, pointwidth::Int, version::Int=0)\n\nRead statistical aggregates of windows of data from BTrDB.\n\nQuery BTrDB for aggregates (or roll ups or windows) of the time series with version between time start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) in nanoseconds.

These statistical aggregates currently include the mean, minimum, and maximum of the data and the count of data points composing the window.\n\nNote that start is inclusive, but end is exclusive. That is, results will be returned for all windows that start in the interval [start, end). If end < start+2^pointwidth you will not get any results.
